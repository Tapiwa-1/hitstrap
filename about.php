            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <p>project will be to eliminate various shortcomings of the traditional operation of the clinic pertaining to the storage and manipulation of patients’ records. The major problems that will be addressed are: record inconsistency, loss of physical records, and unavailability of past records by patients and lack of ease of access to records. The project’s focus is on the development of a web application that will hopefully eliminate all these issues. The system can also be used with other clinics or hospitals and medical practitioners from anywhere across the globe to aid for remote consultations even when both parties are not physically present. It will also aid the secure storage of patient records on a cloud database that will be accessible from within the system; although everyone capable of retrieving this information will have different access rights based on their credentials. This will be done to maintain information security (confidentiality of patient records).</p>

            <h3>Our Aims</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col text-justify">
            <p><span class="my-2 text-justify">Main aim is to create a system that allow ease access, manipulations and storage of patient’s records. As the system will allow the administration to have a monitored access from both the practitioner side and the financial department. We want to create an online graphical user interface that is relatively easy to use and easy to learn to use as well.</span></p>
            <p><span class="my-2">Patient records Management System should follow the standard operating procedures and there will be no chances for deviation to happen in any way. With the implementation of this patient records management systems, practitioners will be able to treat patients with a better way and accessing their real time reports and other information regarding the patients, and their past clinical data and more can be done quickyly and lead to best patient outcomes.</span></p>
            <p><span class="my-2">Patient Records Management System should be more cost effective. The system should help to track and control finances, reduce leakages as well as reduce manual work and therefore there is no requirement of the higher human workforce. The system helps to cut down the manual work done by the humans in the medical institutes especially for those people who take care of the record and documentations safely. The patient management system will also helps in reducing the human resources costs as cost as most of the work is automated.</span></p>
            <p><span class="my-2">Another aim we should achieve is that of reduction in errors. Patients Record Management System will help in reducing different types of errors that made through interventions like missing billing, operational failure, clinical errors, cost leakages, missing appointments and much more. Every process on the system is automated and there are plenty of tasks provided to the software to perform without the human intervention as well as accurately, this reduces the error significantly.</span></p>
            <p><span class="my-2">Our last aim is to ensure data security and data retrieval ability. As information security specialist, we need to make sure that whenever data is entered, manipulated and stored within the system, these activities should be done in line with information security best practices [Confidentiality, Availability, and Integrity]. Patient’s personal information is data that should kepts secret to only two parties the patient and the practioner. Whenever the finance team, practitioner or the administration want to access data, the system should ensure that data is always available to a creadible entity only.</span></p>
